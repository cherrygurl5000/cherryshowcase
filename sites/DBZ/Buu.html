     <h2>Bio:</h2>
     <h4>Buu is considered one of the most powerful villains of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. Bibidi is
         considered his creator because he awakened Majin Buu millions of years prior to Dragon Ball. 
         Bibidi then creates a magical seal that can contain Majin Buu for a temporary amount of time. He 
         uses this seal to control Buu as he takes over worlds. Buu is rewarded with sweets when he is 
         obedient to Bibidi and punished with the seal. Bibidi sends the seal containing Buu to Earth in
         order to conquer Earth. However, Bibidi is killed in battle before he is able to reach Earth. He 
         was able to create a doppleganger (Babidi) who receives Bibidi's full powers upon Bibidi's death. 
         Babidi releases Buu on the Earth. <br />
         One of Buu's powers is absorption. He is able to turn his opponents into candy and eat/absorb them.
         After absorbing the Grand Supreme Kai, he is filled with a child-like innocence that softens his
         demon nature. He later grows tired of being a slave to Babidi and kills him.  He then expels all 
         of the evil in his body into a physical form (Evil Buu). Evil Buu absorbs Buu and becomes Super Buu. 
         Super Buu absorbs many of the people of Earth. When Gohan, Gotenks, Piccolo, and Buu are removed
         from his body, he becomes Kid Buu. <br />
         Kid Buu is the original and most powerful form of Buu. His sole purpose is to kill and destroy. 
         He is often called "evil incarnate". After Kid Buu destroys the Earth, Goku is able to kill him 
         with help from the newly resurrected Earth. Majin Buu is the only remaining form of Buu and he 
         goes on to live and work with Mr. Satan in order to allow Mr. Satan the ability to win tournaments.
