    <div class="Bio">
     <h2>Bio:</h2>
     <h4>Frieza is the youngest son of King Cold. Frieza is ruthless and kills for enjoyment. He believed that his power was the 
         highest of the universe. When Frieza found that the race of people known as Saiyans were beneficial to his operation, 
         he had the Saiyans destroy all life on a planet, and the they sold the planet to buyers. The Saiyans were forced to do 
         everything Frieza asked or to face death at the hands of Frieza. He even had the Prince of the Saiyans, Vegeta, under 
         control. If the Prince didn't do what he said, he would kill the king of the Saiyans, King Vegeta. The Saiyans lived like 
         this for a long time. The Saiyans were tired of this lifestyle and wanted to get out of it, so they revolted. One of the 
         first people to attack Frieza was King Vegeta. Frieza easily killed all of his attackers including the King. Freiza then 
         destroyed Planet Vegeta. 
         <br />
         Frieza later hears of the Namek dragonballs. He decided to go to Namek, so that he could wish for 
         immortality. Frieza and some of his helpers were able to find 5 dragonballs from the towns on Namek. Frieza finds out that 
         Krillin and Gohan are watching him, so he sends his warrior, Dodoria, to kill them. Dodoria fails and is killed, but Frieza
         then finds out that Vegeta is on the planet. Frieza sends Zarbon who transforms and beats Vegeta. Frieza wants Vegeta alive 
         so Zarbon brings him to an isolation chamber to heal. Vegeta escapes with all 5 of the dragonballs after healing in the 
         chamber. Frieza then sends Zarbon to kill Vegeta, but he is killed. Frieza tells the Ginyu Force (a force of very stupid, 
         but strong warriors) to get Vegeta and all of his dragonballs. The Ginyu Force finds Vegeta and all of the dragonballs, 
         plus Krillin and Gohan. Goku eventually defeats the Ginyu Force but not before Frieza gets all 7 dragonballs. 
         <br />
         Frieza can't figure out how to work the dragonballs. He goes to Guru and ends up fighting Nail for the password. He easily 
         defeats Nail. But when he attempts to get the password, Nail tells him that he was a distraction to give the earth people 
         enough time to make their wishes. Frieza leaves in a rage. He gets to the dragonballs, but it's too late. Frieza then starts 
         a long fight against Vegeta, Krillin, Gohan, and Dende. Frieza changes to his second form during these battles. Frieza 
         transforms to his third form when Piccolo joins the battle. He battles and transforms again to his fourth and last form. He 
         then kills Dende and Vegeta. Goku joins the battle and ends up doing a spirit bomb to Frieza. Everyone thinks Freiza is dead, 
         but he tries to kill Piccolo. He fails and takes his wrath out on Krillin. He kills Krillin which angers Goku and gives him 
         the power to turn Super Saiyan. When Frieza fails to kill Goku, he blows up Namek. Goku escapes prior to the explosion. King 
         Cold finds Frieza in space and rebuilds him using metal body parts. Frieza is more powerful upon his return to Earth with 
         King Cold. Frieza again attemps to kill Goku, but is foiled by future Trunks who kills him by slicing him into pieces.
