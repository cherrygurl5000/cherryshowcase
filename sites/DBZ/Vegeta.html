     <h2>Bio:</h2>
     <h4>Vegeta is one of the survivors of the destruction of Planet Vegeta. Vegeta is the Prince of all Saiyans because he is a 
         descendant of the "royal" bloodline. He was out on an assignment when Planet Vegeta was destroyed. After the destruction 
         of his planet, Vegeta became a henchman for Frieza along with Nappa and Radditz (two other surviving Saiyans). Vegeta does 
         everything that Frieza tells him to do until the day that he is able to defeat Frieza. After losing to Goku during the 
         Saiyan Saga, Vegeta only wants a rematch with Goku. He trains tirelessly and occasionally assists Goku in an effort to 
         assure that he always has an opponent. Vegeta spends all of his time seeking supreme power and to be stronger than Goku
         until the end of Dragonball Z when he becomes "truly" good. He is currently married to Bulma and they have two children
         togther, Trunks and Bulla.
